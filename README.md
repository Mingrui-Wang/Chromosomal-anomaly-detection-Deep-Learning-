# Chromosomal anomaly detection
Chromosomal anomaly detection

Performed image preprocessing, including image pre-filtering, background contrast enhancement, chromosome segmentation and zero-padding in Python.
Utilized Intra-Class Splitting (ICS) method to classify normal images and atypical normal images, attaining an overall accuracy rate of 92%; applied Variational Autoencoder for detecting abnormal images; employed reconstruction error as anomaly score and achieved accuracy rate of 96%.
